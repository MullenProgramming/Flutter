# Simply ToDo

This is a simple todo list app created for both android and iOS (available on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store).
The purpose of this project was to have some fun, implement BLoC state management in a simple app, andfamiliarize myself with the updated changes to the Apple App Store publishing process.

There is a lot I would change with this project as far as how the code is structured in order to make it more efficient and easier to read, but I will tackle that another day.

Give it a download and enjoy! :)

### Structure
This app utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, with a utility folder for routing and common values.
